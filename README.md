# Systems Cohort

**Systems Cohort** is building ethical, efficient infrastructure for the future of intelligent computation.

We design and prototype flow-based compute layers with built-in integrity controls, optimized for energy efficiency, behavioral safeguards, and seamless integration with AI and HPC stacks.

> “We don't just compute. We verify, reflect, and adapt.”

This page is a placeholder for our vision. More coming soon.
